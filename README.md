# my-termux-setup
My termux setup for android, to get the most out of my phone.

# Packages I Use

## 1.Aria2
aria2 is a lightweight multi-protocol & multi-source, cross platform download utility operated in command-line. 
It supports HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, BitTorrent and Metalink. [Official Link](https://aria2.github.io/)

>pkg install aria2

## 2.Bash
I write (or modify) scripts from a bash source and find it very easy to make scripts in it. This already comes along within termux.
Run 
>pkg update 
just to be on the latest version.

## 3.Fish
My preferred shell for use in android. Syntax highlighting and tab completion makes it much easier
to use on small screens.

>pkg install fish

After installation type:

>chsh

Then enter 

>fish

When prompted.

Restart the app.

## 4.Megatools
Open-source command line tools for accessing Mega.co.nz cloud storage. [Official Link](https://megatools.megous.com/)

>pkg install megatools

## 5.NNN
Tiny, lightning fast, feature-packed file manager.

Features 
Intuitive navigation through the file-system

Useful nifty shortcuts and key-bindings. [Github Link](https://github.com/jarun/nnn)

>pkg install nnn

## 6.OpenSSH
OpenSSH is the premier connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol. It encrypts all
traffic to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. In addition, OpenSSH
provides a large suite of secure tunneling capabilities, several authentication methods, and
sophisticated configuration options. [Official Link](https://www.openssh.com/)

>pkg install openssh

## 7.Vim
Vim is a highly configurable text editor for efficiently creating and changing any kind of text. It
is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X. [Official
Link](https://www.vim.org/)
